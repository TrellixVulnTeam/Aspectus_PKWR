Yay! A new stickers pack. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your pack.

Alright! Now send me the sticker. The image file should be in PNG format with a transparent layer and must fit into a 512x512 square (one of the sides must be 512px and the other 512px or less).

The sticker should use white stroke and shadow, exactly like in this .PSD example: StickerExample.psd (https://telegram.org/img/StickerExample.psd).

I recommend using Telegram for Web/Desktop when uploading stickers.

Thanks! Now send me an emoji that corresponds to your first sticker.

You can list several emoji in one message, but I recommend using no more than two per sticker.

Congratulations. Stickers in the pack: 1. To add another sticker, send me the next sticker as a .PNG file.

When you're done, simply send the /publish command.

/publish

Please provide a short name for your stickerpack. I'll use it to create a link that you can share with friends and followers.

For example, this set has the short name 'Animals': https://telegram.me/addstickers/Animals

Kaboom! I've just published your sticker pack. Here's your link: https://t.me/addstickers/ImgSeg

You can share it with other Telegram users â€” they'll be able to add your stickers to their sticker panel by following the link. Just make sure they're using an up to date version of the app.
